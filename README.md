## Final Team Project at Telerik Academy: Virtual Wallet Web Application

## Project Overview
We have developed a fintech web application that allows users to send money online through their virtual wallets. Users can create their own virtual wallets, add credit cards, and top-up money from an external banking API integrated into our system. The application provides a seamless experience for transferring money between users while ensuring security and user engagement through various features.

## Key Features
User Registration and Email Confirmation: New users receive an email confirmation upon registration.
Transaction Confirmation: Large transactions require email confirmation with an expiry period.
Multiple Wallets and Cards: Users can create multiple wallets and cards, with options to edit or delete them and designate a primary wallet.
Referral System: Users can refer friends through a registration link sent via email and receive a €20 bonus if the registration is completed within the expiry period.
Detailed Transaction History: Users can filter their transaction history by date, direction (Incoming/Outgoing), counterparty, and sort by amount and date.
User Profile Management: Users can view and edit their personal information, default wallet, total saldo, latest three transactions, and receive inspirational quotes.
Donation Feature: Users have the option to donate €1 upon topping-up, contributing to a designated Donation Project User Account. The total sum gathered from donations is displayed on the homepage.

## Tech Stack

## Backend Technologies
Spring Framework: Utilized both Spring MVC and Spring Boot for creating robust RESTful services and handling web requests.
Hibernate: Employed for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to manage database interactions seamlessly.
Spring Security: Integrated for authentication and authorization to ensure the security of user data and transactions.

## Frontend Technologies
Spring MVC with Thymeleaf: Used for rendering dynamic web pages and templates.
JavaScript & jQuery: Custom scripts enhance user interactions, including features like pop-up modals for confirming transaction details.
CSS: A free CSS template was customized to align with the application’s branding and user experience requirements.

## Getting Started Prerequisites
Java JDK 11 or higher

## My Contribution
In this project, I took on the role of a full-stack Java developer, overseeing the development of our fintech web application from start to finish. I focused primarily on the backend, using Spring MVC, Spring Boot, and Hibernate to create secure and efficient APIs for managing user transactions and wallets. My friends contributed their skills on the frontend, customizing the Thymeleaf templates and enhancing user interactions with JavaScript and jQuery. Together, we built a cohesive and user-friendly platform that provides a seamless experience for our users.
