## Final Team Project at Telerik Academy: Virtual Wallet Web Application

## Project Overview
We have developed a fintech web application that allows users to send money online through their virtual wallets. Users can create their own virtual wallets, add credit cards, and top-up money from an external banking API integrated into our system. The application provides a seamless experience for transferring money between users while ensuring security and user engagement through various features.

## My Contribution
In this project, I took on the role of a full-stack Java developer, overseeing the development of our fintech web application from start to finish. I focused primarily on the backend, using Spring MVC, Spring Boot, and Hibernate to create secure and efficient APIs for managing user transactions and wallets. My friends contributed their skills on the frontend, customizing the Thymeleaf templates and enhancing user interactions with JavaScript and jQuery. Together, we built a cohesive and user-friendly platform that provides a seamless experience for our users.
